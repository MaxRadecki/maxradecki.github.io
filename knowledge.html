    One of my first programming languages I was to learn was Python.
    It took me 6 MONTHS to learn it.
    I then learned a little bash.
    After, I got really familiar with the pygame library.
    I made a small game and am currently still working on it.
    I then learned Ruby.
    I learned Ruby mostly because I was really bored.
    Following that I learned my first two markup languages.
    Those languages were html, css.
    With that I learned JavaScript.
    So I designed this website with that knowledge.
    I did that all in a year.
